         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Mayor and You Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with a great deal of Satisfaction that I meet you here to day, there being ſuch a Union Eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Me and the Gentlemen, as well as other Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Iſland, as ſurpaſſes that of our Predeceſſors, and will be a juſt cauſe of Emulation to thoſe that ſhall come after us; which is to be attributed to the Bleſſing of God, and the Serene and Auſpicious Reign of King <hi>WILLIAM.</hi> I may ſay it with Juſtice, and therefore I ought to ſay it, no Prince that hath ſate upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne hath been more Succeſsful, and no Prince ever uſed his Succeſſes with greater Moderation.</p>
            <p>I have done every thing that is fit for me to do, to ſettle Matters upon a laſting Foundation of Peace and Unity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Iſland; I have examin'd Records and Living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, I have adviſed with ſome of His Majeſties moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Council, with ſeveral of the moſt Experienced and Knowing Members of the Late Parliament, as well as with the prudenteſt and moſt conſiderable Perſons here in the Country; and upon this Advice and Mature Deliberation I have endeavour'd to redreſs all Abuſes, that either by Violence or any other Methods have been introduced, and I have put all His Majeſties Subjects of the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> upon the ſame Bottom, upon which His Majeſty has been graciouſly pleaſed to put the reſt of <hi>England,</hi> in which my Duty and not any private Intereſt has been my Motive and Direction. And I am ſure in this I have done that which will be pleaſing to the King my Maſter, who has done me the Honour to commit to me the Care of this Iſland.</p>
            <p>To theſe endeavours of mine I muſt confeſs I have met
<pb facs="tcp:204309:4"/>with ſuitable Returns from all the Gentlemen, in the greateſt Marks of Reſpect and Affection that are poſſible, accompanied with the deepeſt Expreſſions of Duty and Loyalty to His Majeſty; and if ſome Diſcontents and Animoſities (which have lately happen'd in Your Corporation) were removed; I could ſay, to the great Reputation of this Iſland, that (as to the Concerns of the Publick) we were all of one Mind, and in Peace and Unity within our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not intermeddle (however) with any Differences that have happen'd about the Affairs of your Corporation (though I have heard ſomething of it;) But thus much I am obliged to ſay, not only as your Governour, but as a Chriſtian, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, that every good Man, and every honeſt Man, ſhould have his Eyes upon ſuch Perſons (if any ſuch ſhould be found) as Sacrifice the Affairs of the Publick to their own private Intereſt or Paſſions, or as love Contention for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention's ſake, ſuch Perſons whenever their Party grows to any ſtrength are more dangerous than publick Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one thing which I do moſt earneſtly recommend to your ſerious conſideration and diligent care, and that is the ſuppreſſing (as much as poſſibly you can) Profaneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality. The unſpeakable Diſorders and Extravagancies of this Age, and the Impudence with which Men of ill Principles do every day attack the very Foundation of our Religion, have made the KING think it neceſſary to recommend theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Throne to the great Council of the Nation His Parliament; The Parliament have expreſſed their Senſe of it in an Humble Addreſs to His Majeſty, and by paſſing an Act Purſuant thereunto; and 'tis indiſpenſibly your Duty to God and Man, to your King and Country (and of every Member of your Corporation) to be Serious, Vigilant, and Active, on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It will be no new thing to tell you (and therefore I only put you in mind of it) that the Accounts of all Hiſtories, as well as the Experience of all Mankind, agree in the Confirming of this Truth; that Religion and Virtue promote the Happineſs and Reputation of every Body-polltick, and that Irreligion and Debauchery are the Cauſes of their Misfortune and Diſgrace. Let us make uſe of our Authority; and (every one of us) add the force of our own Example to it; and <hi>I</hi> pray God inable me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſhew you the way.</p>
